                <p class="about-content">I was born in Queens Village in NYC. My parents migrated to this country from Guyana
                    to have a better life and give back to their families. They are my biggest role models for their hard working
                    personality. Growing up in NYC and Queens in specific I was surrounded by the amazing diversity of cultures. 
                    I went to elementary school and middle school right in Queens Village. However for my high school education
                I ventured off to Aviation High School where I learned so much about aviation technology and maintenance, which piqued 
            my curiosity for STEM related activities.  </p>
